Measurement optimization

	1. Specify:
		1.1. The estimated composition 
 		1.2. The instrument (min & max beam energies)
		1.3. The detector (TOA, efficiencies etc.)
	2. Specify the standard blocks that are available
	3. For each element:
		3.1. Search the standard blocks for candidate materials
		3.2. Identify the available x-ray lines
	4. Determine the minimum usable and maximum reasonable beam energy
		4.1. For a range of energies from the minimum up to the maximum in steps of 5 keV
			4.1.1 Calculate the uncertainties for each standard and energies
		4.2. Select the standard and beam energy with the best minimum total uncertainty / the best uncertainty for a specific element
	5. 
			
			3.2.1. Determine a reasonable beam energy (~2.0 times the edge energy)
			3.2.2. Calculate the uncertainty associated with the choice of standard, line and beam energy 
	4. Determine a beam energy which 
		3c. Determine the min and max reasonable beam energies
	4. Determine the min beam energy to measure all elements
